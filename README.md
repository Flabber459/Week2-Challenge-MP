# My Portfolio - Mario Palozzo

I created this portfolio so that I could show my projects and various experiences to potential employers and whoever else I may want to show these things to. It provides a summary of everything that I have done and will do and displays it in a way that also shows off my skills as a programmer.

What did I learn?

Instructions for use:
What the links do (to the page)
What clicking on my email and phnone number does
What it will do (have links to my future projects)
Maybe hover features and that kind of thing?

Screenshots of final product - describe what you can do using them?
